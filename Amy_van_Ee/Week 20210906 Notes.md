## Basic Background
Machine vs Deep Learning

https://www.zendesk.com/blog/machine-learning-and-deep-learning/
- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, but both are forms of artificial intelligence
- Machine learning involves an algorithm that gets progressively better as we give it more information
    - However, when it makes an incorrect prediction, an engineer must step in to help - for deep learning (a subset), the program is able to determine that it is inaccurate itself through its layered neural network
    - In deep learning, can make intelligent decisions on own

**How to choose a project**

https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html
- The three main factors to consider when choosing a project: feasibility, significance, passion
    - Feasibility involves how likely I would be able to complete the project given constraints (energy and time I can invest) and resources (prior knowledge, availability of mentors and other researchers who can help
    - Significance involves both the number of people impacted by the project and the amount of value each person receives from this project
    - Passion is derived from intrinsic motivation, and making sure that the project I choose is one I will enjoy and therefore naturally put more effort and energy into it, resulting in a better product
- All of these three factors come together to choosing a project that will be successful and enjoyable in progressing

**Figure Checklist**

https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html
- Main point 
    - The most important part of a figure is the main point - the main idea that a viewer should be able to draw from looking at the figure
- Data to Ink Ratio
    - Make sure to minimize superfluous details - remove borders, gridlines, legends, data markers, additional axes if they are not necessary. This is referred to as the “data to ink ratio” and it helps the viewer see the data
- Colors
    - Make red the color of what you want to draw the viewer’s attention to
    - Ensure that the color scheme and labeling is consistent across all figures, so that one method is always the same color
    - Schemes
        - Diverging for heatmaps (like green to purple)
        - Sequential blue or orange (e.g. going light blue to dark blue) for showing a change in one variable
        - Qualitative color scheme (for many lines)
- Title
    - Include a title with necessary context and can include a conclusion
- Axes
    - Make sure these are all labeled with units, but show the smallest amount of numbers on the axes themselves - do not show numbers that are not relevant
    - The labels on the axis should not include abbreviations
    - The axes should have reasonable significant digits and minima and maxima
- Text
    - All text must be legible, and the size should be the same as that of the caption
    - Make sure to name the method and use this name throughout
- Caption
    - The first sentence should explain what the figure is showing. All acronyms should be explained, and information such as sample size or type of test should be included
    - Last sentence should point out something interesting about the figure
    - Below the figure
- Lines and Markers
    - The lines need to be thick enough, with markers being sufficiently different 
    - Error bars should be explained in the caption, and if they are absent, it should be clear why they are not included
- Aesthetics
    - Bar charts need to have the vertical axis start at 0, and pie charts can often be represented as stacked barcharts or other graphs
    - Data should be grouped for important comparisons to help viewers make this observation 
    - There should be enough whitespace to avoid a cluttered look
- Multipanel Figures
    - Check if axes can be removed that are redundant
- Table
    - A figure is preferred, and the table can be saved in the appendix
