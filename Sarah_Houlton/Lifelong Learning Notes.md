# Introduction
  * Easy to simultaneously learn, hard to sequentially learn
  * Catastrophic forgetting
    * performance on prior tasks drops after training on new tasks
  * Two approaches to lifelong learning
    * fixed resources, reallocate space as new things are learned, compress
    * add resources as new data arrives
    * both can only really transfer data forward
  * Omnidirectional learning
    * Builds on progressive neural networks
