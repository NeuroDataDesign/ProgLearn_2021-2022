### Proglearn streaming experiments updates
- set up environment for Kevin's proglearn fork
- met with Hao to discuss progress tuesday 
  - looked into overleaf for adding streaming experiments to draft 
  - started writing about results in separate .tex file, will add to overleaf after adding proglearn to plots and discussing restructure of draft with jovo/TAs
  - worked on adding odif to plots 
    - experienced some issues with progressive_learner.py (minor typos) and forest.py (working on resolving (may actually be an issue with my env))
