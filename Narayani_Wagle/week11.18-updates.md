## Team Meeting Notes 11/15
- Gave updates
- Unsure how to divide up tasks going forward
- unsure what expectation for PR is 
- TODO: talk to Jayanta on Tuesday OH

## OH notes
- questions
1) dataset change
2) PR expectation
3) how to divide up work


make tutorial
document
document issues, with preprocessing
existing ways to preprocess
- one pr

- for binary data, run proglearn
- for ade20k, do something outside of proglearn, see how other folks do it

tasks:
- TUTORIAL - PR for all of us
	- tutorial showing preprocessing and passing into proglearn 
	- run forest/nn and show accuracy
	- documentation for everything
	- doesn't need to work
	- add names + emails

- preprocessing ade20k + documentation of issues/discoveries
- rf with binary data in proglearn
- rf with ade20k outside of proglearn
- nn with binary data in proglearn
- nn with ade20k outside of proglearn

## Team Meeting Notes 11/17
- We plan to complete a draft of our tutorial for the PR prior to 11/29
- At the 11/29 Tuesday OH, we will run our tutorial by Jayanta and prepare to make our first version of the PR
- Amy - continue working on rf code for tutorial
- Kevin - continue working on nn code for tutorial
- Narayani - continue preprocessing code for tutorial
- all - document our sections with issues we ran into + useful info we learned
- We might potentially make a README of our documentation too


## Tasks worked on this week
- see slides for updates and go team repo for code: https://github.com/KhelmholtzR/ProglearnSceneSegmentation
- prepared preprocessing section of tutorial
- started looking into models for ADE20k that we can run outside of proglearn to see how they work
