# Meeting Notes
- goal: determine how others have addressed scene segmentation and consider other datasets
- Kevin - continue with ADE20K
- Amy/Narayani - explore alternatives to ADE20K 

# Neural Networks and Scene Segmentation
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9142221 
  - based off of AlexNet
  - extracts semantic features from road images
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329784?casa_token=uNP5fBUkpR0AAAAA:4wPicswlCPDxp_7x3eBkj8PABCk_NwbnQfacF2ecS80Mgv1lZf_Jitz76mLtV6j1g2fxD-g_KrcF
  - Edge detection
  - Entropy-based approaches
  - Region-based CNNs
  - histogram approaches
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6975210
  - used labelled MRI scans

# Datasets
- ISIC (https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/) - 900-30K melanoma images with segmentation masks, binary
- https://github.com/sfikas/medical-imaging-datasets
- OASIS (https://www.oasis-brains.org/) - 400-1000 subjects, need to download to get exact imaging number
