#+TITLE: Balanced Graph Partition

10.1145/1007912.1007931


Graph partitioning problem is dividing vertices of graph $G = (V, E)$ into equally sized parts $V_1, \ldots, V_{k}$ while minimizing the capacity of cut edges.

Problem is strongly NP complete.

* Coarse T-partitioning
A T-partitioning contains only subsets of $T$ and coarse if does not contain any small subsets, specifically whereby a subset does not contain less than $\frac{en}{3k}$ nodes.

Algorithm tries creating coarse $T$-partitionings and merging subsets, but this is not always possible. A $T$ partitioning is $(1+\epsilon)$ feasible if an index of sets can be partitioned into $k$ distinct index sets such that
