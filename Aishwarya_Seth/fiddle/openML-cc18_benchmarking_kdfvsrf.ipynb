    "* KDF Wins/Loses to RF : Documents whether KDF wins or loses when compared with RF\n",
    "* Input Type : Brief description of the input\n",
    "* Output Type : Since OpenML-CC18 is a classification suite, here, the type may be a binary (two-class) or categorical (multi-class) output \n",
    "* Number of Output Classes : Mentions the number of output classes available\n",
    "* Number of Features : Number of input attributes (target output class is included as an attribute). Here, Number of Features = Number of Output Features + Number of Numeric Features + Number of Nominal Features\n",
    "* Number of Output Features : Output class is included in OpenML-CC18 as a nominal feature, to enable this distinction between the output class and the other nominal classes, this column was included\n",
    "* Number of Numeric Features : Number of features having continuous values \n",
    "* Number of Nominal (Categorical) Features : Number of features having discrete values\n",
    "* Number of Instances : Number of samples available. Within the OpenML suite, there are provisions to split the data into the train and test set, but at the dataset level, these are listed in combination as a single dataset \n",
    "* Number of Instances with Missing Data : Identifies how many instances have atleast one missing data point \n",
    "* Percentage of Instances with Missing Data : Identifies the number of instances with missing data as a percentage of the total number of instances. This gices a realistic estimate of how many samples are missing\n",
    "* IMPORTANT NOTES : This column includes any important points to be noted, as presented in the dataset description\n",
