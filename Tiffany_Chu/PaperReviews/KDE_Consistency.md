Fn is an empirical distribution function defining the relationship Fn : R × Ω → \[0, 1\]
Fn converges on F
(hn)n∈N converges to 0

Lebesgue-measurable (LM): a way to measure the size of a set/interval.
"Density" of an LM set A is 0 or 1 at almost every point in R^n 
Ex: "given a square in the plane, the density at every point inside the square is 1, on the edges is 1/2, and at the corners is 1/4.
The set of points in the plane at which the density is neither 0 nor 1 is non-empty (the square boundary), but it is negligible compared to the volume of the square or the infinite space outside it.
